        %h1.section-heading.text-center Getting Fleet Commander
        %hr.primary
        %p
          Fleet Commander consists on two components:

        %ul
          %li a web service integrated with Apache that serves the dynamic application and the profile data to the network.
          %li  and a client side daemon that runs on every host of the network.
        %p
          Fleet Commander relies on libvirt and KVM to generate the profile data
          dinamically from a template VM running the same environment as the rest of the
          network.

        %h2 Setup
        %p
          These are the instructions to build and install the admin interface:
        
        
        :preserve
          <pre>
            <span class="unselectable">$ </span>./configure --prefix=$PREFIX # where $PREFIX can be /usr or /usr/local
            <span class="unselectable">$ </span>make
            <span class="unselectable">$ </span>make install
          </pre>
        
        %p
          You must also create a fleet-commander-admin user and grant it privileges to
          %code /var/lib/fleet-commander-admin 
          and 
          %code /var/lib/fleet-commander-admin/profiles
        %p
          These are the instructions to install the logger and enable a VM as a Fleet Commander template:

        :preserve
          <pre>
            <span class="unselectable">$ </span>./configure --prefix=/usr
            <span class="unselectable">$ </span>make
            <span class="unselectable">$ </span>cd logger
            <span class="unselectable">$ </span>make install
            <span class="unselectable">$ </span>cd ../data/
            <span class="unselectable">$ </span>make install
          </pre>
        %p
          The install prefix must be set to /usr so that the fleet-commander-logger.desktop file makes it
          to the /etc/xdg/autostart directory.
        
        %h2 Note on the Logger
        %p
          The logger autostarts on a desktop session only when a special device shows up in 
          %code /dev/virtio-ports
        %h2 Running the Admin Interface
        %p
          You must first enable the apache configuration, in Fedora systems you must do
          the following as root (assuming you installed it in 
          = succeed "):" do
            %code --prefix=/usr
        :preserve
          <pre>
            <span class="unselectable">$ </span>ln -s /etc/xdg/fleet-commander-apache.conf /etc/httpd/conf.d
            <span class="unselectable">$ </span>systemctl restart httpd
          </pre>
        %p
          And the service must be available as a virtual host in apache, point your
          browser to it and follow the instructions.
